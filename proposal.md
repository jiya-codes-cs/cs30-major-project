# Major Project Proposal

## Description for Major Project
- This project is a webcam-based hand gesture interface for creating and manipulating a dynamic on-screen display. The user's hand movements control the position of a circle and the letters surrounding it. A specific hand gesture can be used to select and "lock" a letter. Once a letter is locked, additional gestures allow the user to modify its visual properties, such as its thickness, color, and design.

## Needs to have list
- Webcam for virtual interaction from user
- Create a circle on the screen beneath the person's face so it's easier for them to see the screen.
- Hand-tracking so they can perform actions
- Allot hand gestures for certain things
- Use MediaScript as a hand-tracking Library

## Nice to have lists
- Add a feature so when the user pinches their (index + thumb) it would lock the letter
- Add the color butons on the right side
- Also add a design tab on the side that becomes a drop-down later on 
- Add multiple colors as option so all the RGB values
