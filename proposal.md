# Major Project Proposal

## Description for Major Project
- This project is a webcam-based hand gesture interface for creating and manipulating a dynamic on-screen display. The user's hand movements control the position of a circle and the letters surrounding it. A specific hand gesture can be used to select and "lock" a letter. Once a letter is locked, additional gestures allow the user to modify its visual properties, such as its thickness, color, and design.

## Needs to have list
- Webcam for virtual interaction from user
- Create a circle on the left side of the screen so it's easier for them to see what they are manipulating
- Then divide it into 26 equal parts and display the letters now
- Generate letter chosen inside the circle
- Hand-tracking so they can perform actions (like with index + thumb they can move around the circle)
- Allot hand gestures for certain things
- Use MediaScript as a hand-tracking Library
- Add rotating sound effects when the user rotates on the letter arc

## Nice to have lists
- Add a feature so when the user pinches their (index + thumb) it would lock the letter 
- Add a fetures like rounding edges
- Add the color butons on the right side(light hue so it's not extremely overpowering)
- Also add a design tab on the side that becomes a drop-down later on 
- Add multiple colors as option so all the RGB values
